Generic potential presentation:

There are many services that are meant to shield various types of people from
harmful content on the internet and in the media. There are proxies that block
material deemed inappropriate on school networks, there are parental filters
that can be setup to protect from the same, and then there are review services.
Specifically with regards to movies, there are services such as Rotten Tomatoes
and IMDB, which are used to review how good a movie is, and are usually
accompanied with an advisory for material deemed potentially offensive, such as
violence, sexual content, use of illicit substances, etc.

Not one of these services provides a way for people who are offended by the
misrepresentation of minorities, specifically minorities they are a part of,
to see community ratings about how a particular movie portrays that minority.

Too often it is an issue that entire groups of society are left out, 
intentionally misrepresented, or stereotypically represented. By creating this
site, we are providing a way for people that are offended by this to both
express, in the form of a rating, how they felt a movie portrayed particular
social groups, and also a place for them to see opinions on how well groups
were represented prior to potentially being offended.




DEMO: We included a variety of functionality in the site. First and foremost, we
have our homepage. We made sure to make the user interface as clutter-free
and user friendly as possible. We included easy to find reviews, including a
Most Recent reviews (give a moment for people to read through most recent
review).
