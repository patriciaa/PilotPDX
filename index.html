        <h1>Representation Tomatoes</h1>
        <p class="lead">Women, people of color, people of non-normative sexualities, people of disabilities: All are grossly underrepresented in media today. Representation Tomatoes challenges the erasure of oppressed groups in society. Movies are ranked by you and for you, so you can choose what you want to pay $12 to see.</p>

          <h4>Representation of POC/Minorities</h4>
          <p>People of Color and Minorities play an important role in representing a cohensive society. Films without these people fail in this sense, and also in combating the institutional racism associated with hiring actors and actresses of color.</p>
	  <p>Films that represent POC and minorities well:</p>
	  <p><a href="#">The Help</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">The Color Purple</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">The Princess and the Frog</a></p>

          <h4>Representation of People with Disabilities</h4>
          <p>It's difficult to find films that represent people with disabilities well. However, representation is important in making all people feel included and accepted as normal in society. Because of this, further efforts should be made to include people with disabilities in film and media.</p>
	  <p>These films represent people with disabilities well:</p>
	  <p><a href="#">Rain Man</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">There Will Be Blood</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">Quid Pro Quo</a></p>

          <h4>Top Reviews</h4>
          <p>These films have been reviewed as being the most successful in their representation of a wide variety of people:</p>
	  <p><a href="#">The Women of Brewster Place</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">The Peculiar Kind</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">Change</a></p>


          <h4>Representation of Women</h4>
          <p>Women make up over 50% of the world's population and yet make up only about 30% speaking characters. It is vital for film and media to equally represent women and men in film and entertainment; however, blatant sexism still seems to be a popular videographic device.</p>
	  <p>These films represent women well:</p>
	  <p><a href="#">The Hunger Games</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">Thelma & Louise</a></p>

          <h4>Representation of LGBT People</h4>
          <p>LGBT people, now more than ever, must receive appropriate representation in film and media. As the struggle for equal rights heightens, acknolwedgement, not erasure, should be the forefront in entertainment.</p>
	  <p>Films that represent LGBT people well:</p>
	  <p><a href="#">The Kids Are Alright</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">Brokeback Mountain</a></p>
	  <p><a href="#">Death in Venice</a></p>

        <h1>About Representation Tomatoes</h1>
        <p class="lead">Representation Tomatoes was created by a group of high school students from Oregon during the PilotPDX hackathon. Concerned with social justice and ready to code, Lucas, Patricia, Abhinav, and Minjin created Representation Tomatoes. It's a way to rate films based on their representation of women, minorities, people of color, people with disabilities, and LGBT people based on quality (if representation exists at all!)</p>
