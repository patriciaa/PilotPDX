          <h4>Role of Women (6)</h4>
          <p>When Tiana was a young girl, her father would tell her how good food brought people together. Her father worked long hours at the mill to provide for his family, but had a different dream; to open up a restaurant. When her father died before reaching that dream, Tiana set on with his example: work hard to get what you want. On the contrary, Charlotte La Bouff, Tiana’s friend is from a wealthy family and has never had to work. </p>

          <h4>Portrayal of LGBT Characters (NR)</h4>
          <p>No Representation</p>
          <h4>Overall Representation (7)</h4>
          <p>This, like most Disney movies, is a good family movie. There are traces of misrepresentaions, however.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Portrayal of Minorities and People of Color(8)</h4>
          <p>It is clear who the “minority” is if Prince Naveen were to compare himself to Tiana. Although Naveen is disinherited by his parents (until he marries), he has no care in the world. </p>

          <h4>Portrayal of Disabled Characters (NR)</h4>
          <p>No Representation</p>

          <h4>Who should watch this movie?</h4>
          <p>All ages; however, children of young age may be "molded" by this movie when they are older</p>
