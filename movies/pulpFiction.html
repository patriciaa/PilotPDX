          <h4>Role of Women : 5</h4>
          <p>Pulp fiction has a variety of female characters. Fabienne is a rather silly and childish 
		  character who appears dependent on her boyfriend, Butch. On the other end of the spectrum, 
		  Yolanda fearlessly robs a diner with her partner Ringo. Somewhat in the middle of the two 
		  is Mia who overdoses on cocaine and tries to cheat on her husband. The portrayal of women 
		  in Pulp Fiction is mixed, and there are significantly fewer female characters than male.
		  </p>

          <h4>Portrayal of LGBT Characters : 1</h4>
          <p>The only LGBT characters in Pulp Fiction are a couple of gay red-necks gun store owners who rape one of 
		  the main characters. Although Pulp fiction has some LGBT representation, they are wildly 
		  misrepresented as red-neck rapists.
		  </p>

          <h4>Overall Representation : 3</h4>
          <p>Pulp fiction misrepresents many groups of people that are often misrepresented in movies,
		  although there is a wide variety of female characters. Pulp Fiction also has a lack of under-represented
		  groups of people.
		  </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Portrayal of Minorities and People of Color(3)</h4>
          <p>The only non-caucasian character in Pulp Fiction is Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel 
		  L. Jackson. Juels is portrayed as a somewhat ghetto black man in Pulp Fiction, and misrepresents
		  the Arican American Population of America. Most other minorities don't appear in the movie.
		  </p>

          <h4>Portrayal of Disabled Characters (n/a)</h4>
          <p>There are no disabled characters in Pulp Fiction</p>

          <h4>Who should watch this movie?</h4>
          <p>People who are sensitive about the portrayal of people of no-traditional sexual orientation, or sensitive to the portrayal of minorities should not watch Pulp Fiction. Everyone else should watch Pulp Fiction since it is one of the best movies of all time.</p>
